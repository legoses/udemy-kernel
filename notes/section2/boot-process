# steps to a booted system
- BIOS is executed from ROM
- BIOS loads bootloader into 0x7C00
- BIOS executed bootloader, which loads the kernel

# what is a bootloader
- Small program that loads the kernel of an operating system
- Generally writted by the creater of the oeprating system

- on first boot, we will be in real mode, which gives access to 1mb of memory and 16bit processes
- then boot into protected mode, which gives 4,b of memory, and 32 bit porocesses

# on boot, CPU loads bios
- BIOS executes diretly from ROM
- BIOS will init essential hardware
- BIOS looks for a bootloader by search all storage meduims for the signatue "0x55AA" and loads it to 0x7C00
- Sector - block of storage. Many disks have 512 byte sectors

# BIOS is execued directly from ROM
- CPU executed instructions from the BIOS ROm
- BIOS generally loads itsself into ram
- BIOS inits all essential hardware
- BIOS searches storage meduims for boot signature "0x55AA"
- BIOS loads bootloader into RAM at absolute address 0x7c00
- BIOS instructs process to jump to absolute addders 0x7c00 and begin executing the systems bootloader

# BIOS is a kernel its self
- contains routines to assist bootloader
- 16 bit code, which means only 16 bit code can execute properly
- routiens are generic and standard so they can work between different BIOS's
