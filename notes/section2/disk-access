# Files do nt exist
- file systems are kernel implemented, not responsibility of hard disk
- disk only holds data block, called sectors
- kernel must have driver that targets diver system on the disk

# data is typically written in sectors
- data is typically read and written in 512 byte blocks

# CHS (Cylinder head sector)
- old style of reading disk
- sectors are selected and read by specifying a head, track, and sector

# LBA (Logical block address)
- modern way of reading through adisk
- rather than specifying head, track, and sector, just specity a number that starts from zero
- allows us to read from disk as if we were reading from a very large file
- LBA 0 - first sector
- LBA 1 - second sector

# Calculating LBA
- Lets read byte as position 58376
  - LBA - 58376 / 512 = 114
  - READ LBA and load 512 bytes into memory
  - next we need to know uot offset that our byte is in the buffer
  - offset = 58376 % 512 = 8
    - 8 bytes into buffer

# BIOS disk routines
- in 16 bit real mode, bios provides 13h register for disk operations
