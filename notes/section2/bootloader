# assembly syntax
- dw means two bytes
- when inderted at the end of a programa out side of a methid, a dw will append its raw binary to the end of the file
- $ probably means current memory address and $$ probably means the beginning of the file

# bootloader
- file is 512 bytes to match our boot sector size. 510 bytes for the code, and 2 bytes at the end for the dw file signature
- the bootloader is assembled straight to binary because it is executing on the raw cpu with out any concept of files
- a binary file is just a file without headers
