# Interrupt descriptor table
- how interrupts are invoked in protected mode
- can be mapped anywhere in memory

# Interrupt descriptor
- 

# Gate types
- 32 bit task gate - 0x05/0b0101 - references TSS descriptors and can assist in multi tasking when exceptions occur
- 16 bit interrupt gate - 0x06/0b0110 - used for interrupts we want to invoke ourselfs in code
- 16 bit task gate - 0x07/0b0111 - Used for exceptions. Also disablle interrupts on entry (like iret) and re enables them on an "iret" instruction
- 32 bit interrupt gate - same as 16 bnit
- 32 bit trap gate - same as 16 bit

# Interrupt desciprtor array
- Interrupts descritors are stored in an array with an index of 0 defining interrupt 0 "int 0", index 1 definint interrupt 1, and so on

# IDTR
- structor that points to itnerrupts descriptor table and specifies size
- length is stored as (length - 1)
- limit - bits 0-15 - length of descriptor table minus 1
- base - bits 16-47 - the address of the interrupt descriptor table

# load interrupt descriptor table
- call idt_load function  which we will define later
