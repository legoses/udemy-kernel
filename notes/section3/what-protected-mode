# What is protecetd mode?
- processor statin in x86 artichetectures
- 4gb addressable memory
- hardware protection
- different memroy schemes

# memory and hardware protection
- protected mode allows you to prevent memory and hardware from being accessed by user programs
- 7 rings
  - ring 0 is most priveledged - kernel
  - ring 1 and 2, mosly arent used, sometimes used by device drivers
  - ring 3 is least priveledged, runs user code
  - ring 3 can not access some interrupts

# Memory schemes
- Segement registers become selectors
- Paging - remmapping memory addresses

# Selector memroy scheme
- Segmentation registers become selector registers
- slectors point to data structors that describe memory ranges and the permissions to access a given range

# Paging memory scheme
- Memory is virtual and whta you adcdress can pointe to somewhere entirely different in memory
- memory protection is easier to control
- Page directorty is a table of pointers that point to page tables
  - tables map out range of addresses
- allows all programs to believe they are loaded at the same address
- cant see other programs running
- multiple processes can be mapped at the same address
